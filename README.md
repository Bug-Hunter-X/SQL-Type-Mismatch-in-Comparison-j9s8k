# SQL Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common SQL error: performing comparisons between numeric values and strings. The `bug.sql` file contains a query that is prone to this error. The `bugSolution.sql` file presents the corrected version.

**Problem:**
The original SQL query tries to compare a numeric value (salary) with a string, which can lead to unexpected results or errors depending on the database system.
